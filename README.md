## First Application
The first test case that I ran using Twitters API and my developer account was to see if there was a way I could like a specific tweet without ever having to go on Twitter. While this test case my only be used by a handful of individuals, it allowed me to see how the API worked, along with just how powerful this tool is. This involved using python code and I have attached the open source code that I used, named `LikeTweetFromTerminal.py` to this GitHub project for reference. I used an adaptation of code from Twitters Developers but had to trouble shoot many issues that I ran into. First, making sure that you have an authorized API key and API Secret Key is vital. Secondly, you must enter the userID of the account that you made your developer account. This is not your user name, this is the ID associated with your username, which can be found at the website I linked in the comments of the code. Next, in the payload variable you need to specific the tweets ID that you want to like. This can be located in your web address by locating the tweet and taking everything after `status\`. Now we can see that this code requests a token using your entered API key and API Secret Key. There will be web address that displays in the terminal that you must copy and past into your browser. You will be prompted by a display to allow your created app access. A pin number will then be displayed, which will need to be copied and pasted back into your terminal window to authenticate. You have then granted access and the request is made and then saved, ultimately liking the specified tweet. I have attached a screenshot below of the output of this code, showing that “liked” is now true.

## Second Application
The second test cast that I ran was through Twitters Postman tool. The first step was to load Twitter API v2 postman collection into my environment. I had to create an account in postman, which then loaded in this API for me. For this test case, I decided to pull liked Tweets from a specific user. I navigated to the likes folder and then `GET Liked Tweets`. After this tab was opened in my application, I had to make sure that when I made a GET request like this, it would be authenticated. This required me to go to the authentication tab and enter in my Bearer Token, which is located in the Developer Portal on Twitter. After this was done, I had to decide who I wanted to pull liked tweets from. For this example, I used Tesla. Under the Params tab, scroll down to the path variables and next to id, enter the userID, or value, for Tesla here. You can again get this ID through the website I mentioned in my previous test case. Scroll back up and decided what parameters you want to display in the output. I selected only the user fields for this example and set the max_results to 10. Now we can hit send and should see our results below our selected fields. It is listed in a JSON format and can be downloaded by going to Save Response and then Save to a file. This is a simple example of how this tool works but also displays the power of it.
